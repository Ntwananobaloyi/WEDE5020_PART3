Body content 

Title tags 

Include main keywords 

The clickable headline shown in search results 

Meta description 

I ensured all the meta description engage, describe and include keywords 

Header Tags 

Structure the page logically 

 

FORM Validation 

I added javascript form validation to ensure that the user inputs meet certain requirements and is correct before a form is submitted 

LIGHTBOX 

Added a pop overlay that opens when you click the images to ensure that the user can be able to view content clearly and make images appear more professional 

 

 

Creating forms within html 

Used the <form> element to create a section of webpages that collect user input and used JavaScript to make it interactive and smart 

MAP INTERACTIVITY 

Embedded a map within html to ensure that clients always have access to our location
